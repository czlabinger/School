# Diff/Patch

Diff/Patch algorithms are crucial. Efficiency improvements in these algorithms boost system performance.
Can be used for plaintext and many more.

Diff updates server shadows with client changes. It needs to differentiate minimal edits from semantic intent ensuring meaningful updates.

Compares identical texts efficiently.
Identifies shared starting/ending strings to speed up comparisons.
Detects if a change is an addition or removal bypassing complex calculations.


Patches apply accurately, even if texts arenâ€™t exact matches, using the Bitap algorithm for efficient near-match location. Merging non-text content may use a "last user wins" approach to prevent incorrect combinations.
Handling Collisions: Systems can address patch errors either by frequent, silent synchronization or user intervention on failed patches, balancing usability with data accuracy.
