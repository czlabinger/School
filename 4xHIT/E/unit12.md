A: It's great that we've been awarded this big new office furniture contract, but I'm worried that it's more than our **staff**
can handle. We just don't have enough workstations...

B: Or workers. We've lost a few experienced people recently and our current intake of new **apprentices** isn't ready to be given full responsibility yet. I have to **supervise** them constantly and that just creates extra work. No, I've
been thinking the same thing. I wonder if there is a part of this job that we can **outsource** to another company?

A: I've brought that up with the CEO already. She has discussed it with the **managment**  but they're worried about maintaining quality.

B: Don't you I think it's time we considered some kind of long-term solution to this problem? We could even consider **offshoring to the** Philippines or Indonesia.

A: Hmm, I can't see our **department** on the factory floor - or their union - being very keen on that idea!
